```

## Ranking of strategies by average payoff across matches
```{r, echo=FALSE,results='asis'}
  view(strat.rank.from.matches(md))
```
Note: The sigma.rank of a strategy i is given by 1 plus the number of strategies j whose payoff is larger by more than the sum of standard errors for i and j. This means strategies whose payoffs are statistically too close to each other can have the same sigma.rank.
